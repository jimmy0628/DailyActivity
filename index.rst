What is altruism
================

Altruism is a character that makes people to help others without an expectation of reward, that it is commonly seen as a moral quality of a person. The observation ranges from that, parents always invest great energy nurturing children without hoping benefits for themselves, wealthy people often participate in programs that aim to eliminate poverty in developing countries with their own investment, to sometimes people even save a stranger from danger on the cost of his own life. 

Some people believe that altruism is a sacred creed because only human has free will and understand the whole welfare of the human being as a whole. People invest time, energy and money to help others for nothing but for the good of whole society.  In the past, in the name of the nation, or God, people were willing to fight to death. Its peak is the WWII, in which people kill each other literally for nothing but for the good of their own imagined common entity, their country.  

However, many animals, even insects also have similar behaviors that benefit the whole species, or at least the swarm. For example, ants will sacrifice themselves when crossing a stream that lay before their road to the destination by forming an ants bridge to allow the following ants to go across on it.
