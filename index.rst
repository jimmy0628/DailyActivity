What is altruism
----------------

Altruism is a character that makes people to help others without an expectation of reward, that it is commonly seen as a moral quality of a person. The observation ranges from that, parents always invest great energy nurturing children without hoping benefits for themselves, wealthy people often participate in programs that aim to eliminate poverty in developing countries with their own investment, to sometimes people even save a stranger from danger on the cost of his own life. 

Some people believe that altruism is a sacred creed because only human has free will and understand the whole welfare of the human being as a whole. People invest time, energy and money to help others for nothing but for the good of whole society.  In the past, in the name of the nation, or God, people were willing to fight to death. Its peak is the WWII, in which people kill each other literally for nothing but for the good of their own imagined common entity, their country.  

However, many animals, even insects also have similar behaviors that benefit the whole species, or at least the swarm. For example, ants will sacrifice themselves when crossing a stream that lay before their road to the destination by forming an ants bridge to allow the following ants to go across on it. 

Farewell letter to the GTAC IT team
-------------------------------------

Dear my lovely colleagues and friends:

Today is my last day here in Huawei. The time of the past 3 years with the GTAC IT team is an arduous, but rewarding and satisfying experience for me. Working with you guys gave me a great valuable memory that worth recalling all the time in my future life. During the time, I have learned how communicating and negotiating with people with different angles and unique visions, how viewing from different perspectives with a different mindset, which, I firmly believe, is the most valuable asset for my future career advancement.

First and foremost, please permit me to take this opportunity to express my sincere regards to the GTAC IT team, and to my mentors who had taught me new knowledges. Without your gorgeous supports and wholeheartedly guidances, I would never have a chance of making progress, not mention any achievements in this job in such a great company of Huawei.

Whereas my not going with the team anymore out of personal reasons, GTAC IT, to me, is a groovy and nice workplace that has granted me the chance to hone my knowledges and expertise, so that I had a view of how disparate products serving as an integrated solution that dispenses unique values to variety clients respectively, therefore I firmly believe that it is worth investing my energy, passion and time here.

Everyone has his own journey, so do I. Please pardon my leaving and I wish you have a bright, continuous successful career and a happy life. I hope I am allowed to keep contact with such a talent team. Please definitely feel free to reach me by my personal way of contacts, I feel honored when I am needed by you. 

Finally, I am a big fan of science fiction. By reading science fiction stories makes me feel I am not alone and I have a bright future by making progress with technologies along the way. You may notice in my email signature, there is a quote by Arthur C Clark, one of my favorite hardcore science story writers.  I`d like to share with you another quote from him as well below.



** I donâ€™t pretend we have all the answers. But the questions are certainly worth thinking about. -- Sir Arthur C Clark **



Yes, like questions, the future is also worth thinking about. 


Best Regards
