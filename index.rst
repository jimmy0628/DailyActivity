This is a site to make valueble notes to myself. 


How to setup RSA key for linux server
---------------------------------------

Reference:
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-ssh-key-based-authentication-on-a-linux-server

1. Generate RSA key on your local client 
ssh-keygen
This command will generate a pair of private key and public key 

2. Upload the public key to the remote server.
ssh-copy-id -p port_number user@host

What is altruism
----------------

Altruism is a character that makes people to help others without an expectation of reward, that it is commonly seen as a moral quality of a person. The observation ranges from that, parents always invest great energy nurturing children without hoping benefits for themselves, wealthy people often participate in programs that aim to eliminate poverty in developing countries with their own investment, to sometimes people even save a stranger from danger on the cost of his own life. 

Some people believe that altruism is a sacred creed because only human has free will and understand the whole welfare of the human being as a whole. People invest time, energy and money to help others for nothing but for the good of whole society.  In the past, in the name of the nation, or God, people were willing to fight to death. Its peak is the WWII, in which people kill each other literally for nothing but for the good of their own imagined common entity, their country.  

However, many animals, even insects also have similar behaviors that benefit the whole species, or at least the swarm. For example, ants will sacrifice themselves when crossing a stream that lay before their road to the destination by forming an ants bridge to allow the following ants to go across on it. 

Farewell letter to the GTAC IT team
-------------------------------------

Dear my lovely colleagues and friends:

Today is my last day here in Huawei. The time of the past 3 years with the GTAC IT team is an arduous, but rewarding and satisfying experience for me. Working with you guys gave me a great valuable memory that worth recalling all the time in my future life. During the time, I have learned how communicating and negotiating with people with different angles and unique visions, how viewing from different perspectives with a different mindset, which, I firmly believe, is the most valuable asset for my future career advancement.

First and foremost, please permit me to take this opportunity to express my sincere regards to the GTAC IT team, and to my mentors who had taught me new knowledges. Without your gorgeous supports and wholeheartedly guidances, I would never have a chance of making progress, not mention any achievements in this job in such a great company of Huawei.

Whereas my not going with the team anymore out of personal reasons, GTAC IT, to me, is a groovy and nice workplace that has granted me the chance to hone my knowledges and expertise, so that I had a view of how disparate products serving as an integrated solution that dispenses unique values to variety clients respectively, therefore I firmly believe that it is worth investing my energy, passion and time here.

Everyone has his own journey, so do I. Please pardon my leaving and I wish you have a bright, continuous successful career and a happy life. I hope I am allowed to keep contact with such a talent team. Please definitely feel free to reach me by my personal way of contacts, I feel honored when I am needed by you. 

Finally, I am a big fan of science fiction. By reading science fiction stories makes me feel I am not alone and I have a bright future by making progress with technologies along the way. You may have noticed in my email signature, there is a quote by Arthur C Clark, one of my favorite hardcore science story writers. I`d like to share with you another quote from him as well below.



**I donâ€™t pretend we have all the answers. But the questions are certainly worth thinking about. -- Sir Arthur C Clark**



Yes, like questions, the future is also worth thinking about. 


Best Regards

Thinking on AI
--------------

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been becoming more of the essence since the computing power bottleneck was broken thanks to introducing the GPU based vector calculation. AI is reshaping our IT industry as well as our society.

Rather than a future, a reality is AI. It has been adopted widely in the almost every corner of our lives ranging from online shopping to the security market.  Our navigation history of web surfing is exploited by companies to display ads that we don`t want, and our locations, preferences and other personal information are also collected and may be handed over to the government. All facades of our lives are driven by data that is analyzed by AI in the cloud. No matter you like or not, it is becoming an existence that can not be untangled from us. 

Is it benign or malignant to us?  Some people argue we human should be cautious about the AI development, otherwise, the evil robots will wipe out us from the surface of our planet in the future just like how we treat so-called lower class animals, whereas others believe we will merge with AI and become augmented superhuman with the aid from magic capacity provided by good-will AI. However, it is not related if the AI will behave mercifully to us, but how our society will evolve in the direction that maximizes the overall benefit of us as a species. 

Big companies are becoming behemoths that are feed by our digital footprints, and digest the data to grow bigger.  We cannot resist. Like the Big Brother, the AI is watching us behind every screen we have. The power balance has tilted towards the dictatorship by the big platforms. Think about this scenario. Our personal AI prescribes a better route to the work when we drive, and according to the experiences, it is highly possible AI is correct, should we follow the guide? Because we know AI is almost always correct. If not, we will face the pending penalty of being late to the work. The situation will be like, as the power of AI grows, we should follow almost every decree from AI. So where is the free will of the human being, which is the foundation of our society? 

Besides the concerns that are introduced by the good-will AI mentioned above, vice organizations like the government cannot help from exploiting insights provided by the almost omnipotent AI. The Chinese Government is building a "Social Credit System" that records its citizens` records of behaviors, and scores accordingly. Then via current primal AI technology, people are cataloged into different groups accordingly, and the government is monitoring the people tagged as the danger.  At the same time, the notorious GFW that divides the internet into two separate sub-net, China and the rest of the world is becoming smarter by analyzing network traffic pattern so that it can detect the "illegal traffic" and update the blacklist more efficiently. 

Finally, I believe the thinking and discussion on AI will not end. At least, AI and related innovations make us more productive. At the same time,  heavily rely on data, AI at this moment is harming our core values that cannot be quantified that it may strange our organizations, governments, and societies, and which will be far stranger than we can expect now.

To err is human, to forgive AI
--------------------------------

AI is breaking the delicate equilibrium among the five factors of productivity increase, job disappearance, new work occupant creation, and the speed of new skill learning, and the location of works. 

In history, when a new technology appears, it will replace one or multiple old vacations so that the productivity increases and the original professions disappear. At the same time, the new technology also introduces more new occupations that require new skill sets, which make people have to learn new skills. It is a balance that people have adequate time to absorb new knowledge to be eligible for the new tasks after the old ones vanish and the new jobs are already in the reach.

For example, supermarket, out of economies of scale, outperforms the local grocery stores. By introducing a supermarket in one area, several local groceries nearby will extinct, and the families that depend on these stores will suffer. However, the living standard of this area will increase because of the productivity gains. People that are used to work in the grocery stores can pick up the new skills of working in supermarkets and start their new life. They have enough time to learn because of a slow change, and the jobs are still in the local area. 

However, comes the AI. AI is so powerful that brings us both prosperity as a whole and sufferings as an individual by breaking of the equilibrium. 

Firstly, the jobs wiped out by AI are usually the ones for the middle class. For example, it is predictable that the AI Medical Diagnosis from IBM or other tech giants will replace human doctors in the foreseeable future. Ditto for lawyers, teachers, and even software engineers. These middle-class workers have spent several years to make themselves highly specialized in a single field to be eligible for the current professional tasks. Once their jobs have vaporized, the time and cost of learning a new will be scaring. 

Furthermore, whereas the distribution of new jobs varies among distinct industries, more and more opportunities are only accessible to the top talent of that profession. AI often do much better than the average human peers with much lower cost. Let me give you an example in the creative industry, that was a human monopoly as we have always believed. AI now can compose music without human aid, and to the music listeners, they can hardly distinguish if the music is from AI composer or a human artist. It implies the average music writers are on the verge to be replaced by AI and only the top artist still has the chance to survive in the industry.

Thirdly, the locations of jobs are migrating globally. As AI develops, it will eliminate local or domestic businesses and create new works remotely even in other nations. Governments and policymakers are in the hot debate to balance the protectionism and openness to help people find their niches locally.  As AI develops, it will integrate with cloud and serve customers as a cloud-based service around the globe. By doing that, the relevant works will migrate from the local business to global cloud providers such as Google, Amazon, and Alibaba.  Combined with the point mentioned above, the new jobs are only available to the well-educated, smart and AI-augmented elites in megacities or even megacities of foreign countries. 

Like other technologies, AI will create more jobs, boost the productivity of society, elevate the overall living standard of the human. However, as an individual, it may mean different. Our conditions will transform into a far stranger equilibrium, which is far stranger than we most expect, in a transit fashion. We have to be agile enough to reshape ourselves to fit the pending change. Not all people can catch up the speed, that we will fall into the artificial hell created by artificial intelligence if we cannot.
